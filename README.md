This is a single-player arcade game inspired by Touhou. The goal of the game will be to achieve the highest possible score. 
You will be able to use the arrow keys to move the character around, and the ‘z’ and ‘x’ keys to activate additional abilities.
While playing the game, you control a flying character, and dodge projectiles coming at you. The projectiles emanate 
from a boss character, which also moves around. The goal of the game is to survive as long as possible, which will 
exponentially increase your game score.

TL;DR: bullet hell game

Be aware that the game has a fixed window size, which may not be compatible with your own device.
